# Encapsulation: 
- This principle focuses on the bundling of related data and functions into an object, allowing access only through the object's methods.
- It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and protects the data from unauthorized access.
- The main advantage of encapsulation is that data is hidden and protected from randomly access by outside non-member methods of a class.
- Encapsulation is the process of binding data and methods in a single unit.
- In encapsulation, data(variables) are declared as private, and methods are declared as public
