# Static Variable

1. Variables declared with the `static` keyword inside a class, but outside any method, constructor, or block.
2. Belongs to the class rather than any object. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
3. Stored in the static memory. Only one copy exists regardless of the number of instances.
